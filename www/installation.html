<h2>Installation and compatibility</h2>
<div class="maf-box-warning">
  <p>Firefox add-on technology is modernizing, and traditional add-ons like
   Mozilla Archive Format will stop working soon. The announced cut-off date is
   <b>November 14, 2017</b>.</p>
</div>
<p>See the <a href="documentation.html">add-on documentation</a> for an overview
 of the recommended alternatives.</p>
<p>You can still install the Mozilla Archive Format add-on on the latest
 versions of Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) from
 the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/212">Firefox Add-ons</a>
 website. When this add-on is installed in Firefox, however, performance may be
 reduced because the optimized multi-process mode of the browser will be
 disabled.</p>
<p>The most recent version of the add-on is not expected to be compatible with
 older versions of the browser or with pre-release channels such as Nightly and
 Beta.</p>

<h2>License and previous versions</h2>

 developed by Paolo Amadini. The latest version of the add-on is available under
