<h2>Historical archive of the Mozilla Archive Format add-on</h2>
<p>While the Mozilla Archive Format add-on is no longer maintained, the
 <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/maf/maf-5.2.1-signed.xpi">final
 version</a> released in 2018 can be installed offline on <a
 href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/56.0.2/">Firefox 56</a> to
 <a href="documentation.html">convert saved pages to other file formats</a>.
 Using outdated software can result in security vulnerabilities and may corrupt
 user profile data, hence this procedure should only be followed by experienced
 users on a separate computer that is not connected to the Internet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mozdev.org/projects/overview/maf/">Previous versions</a>
 of the add-on and their <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> are also
 available as a historical archive. Some versions of the add-on can only be
 installed on pre-release versions of Firefox after disabling the signature
 requirement. The XPI packages contain the original source code as well as
 information about which Open Source and Free Software license applies.</p>
<p>The Mercurial version control repository can be downloaded with the
 command:</p>
<pre>hg clone http://hg.mozdev.org/maf/</pre>
