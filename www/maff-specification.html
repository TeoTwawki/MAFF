  <h2 class="page-header">The MAFF specification</h2>

<p>This document is a <b>working draft</b> aimed at providing a detailed
 specification for the <a href="maff-file-format.html">MAFF file format</a>,
 with the goal of ensuring the interoperability between different
 implementations.</p>

<p>In this stage of development, this document describes the essential aspects
 of the file format and is updated to reflect actual technical questions or
 foreseen implementation issues. Implementations based solely on this document
 are not recommended; developers are instead encouraged to discuss their
 implementations on the <a href="#feedback">mailing list of the MAF
 project</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="index.html">Mozilla Archive Format</a> extension for Firefox
 currently implements the MAFF specification at the
 <a href="#level-basic">basic</a> conformance level. Eventually, the MAF
 extension will be updated to the <a href="#level-normal">normal</a>
 conformance level, when the related aspects of the specification are
 stabilized.</p>

<h2><a name="feedback"></a>Feedback</h2>
<p>This working draft for the MAFF specification is maintained by the <a
 href="members.html">MAF project</a>. Feedback from interested people or
 implementors is welcome on the <b>MAF mailing list</b>.</p>

<h2><a name="feedback"></a>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>MAFF is meant to be a <b>simple</b> format for <b>archiving</b> a copy of
 some <b>web content</b> in a <b>single file</b>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Saving web pages</b></p>
    <p>MAFF can be used by a web browser as a destination file format when
     saving a web page, and all the other resources required for rendering it,
     to a local file system for later reference.</p>
    <p>Even though the same operation could be done by saving multiple files
     with relative references to each other, in practice this approach is not
     robust. When moving the saved files in the same file system, care should be
     taken not to change their relative locations, lest the content become
     unusable. Moreover, when files are moved across file systems that support
     different naming restrictions, like when authoring a CD-ROM, automatic
     renames performed on the individual files may make the archived page
     unusable, and recovering at a later time can be difficult.</p>
    <p>Collections of MAFF files, instead, can be safely organized using the
     operating system's file manager, and moved across different file systems
     with no risk of making the content unusable. No additional software besides
     the file manager is required in order to organize the collection.</p>
    <p>For this use case, MAFF is comparable to MHTML, even though the two
     formats are very different in other regards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Tracking the source of archived content</b></p>
    <p>The original URL the content was saved from, and the local date and time
     of the save operation, are the essential information required to locate the
     source of the saved content. This information can be used for later
     reference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Packaging related content together</b></p>
    <p>MAFF files can also be authored originally, instead of being saved by a
     web browser. In this case, they can be used to package related resources
     that are not meant to be severed.</p>
    <p>The fact that MAFF files can be easily inspected and edited with existing
     tools helps in making this independent authoring very easy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Other considerations</b></p>
    <p>In MAFF files, dynamic features like JavaScript are available, even
     though they can be expected to work properly only as long as they do not
     depend on external resources.</p>
    <p>The MAFF file format is not meant to be a complete offline cache, or a
     file format that can be used to replay client-server transactions. Pages
     saved inside MAFF archives should be treated as an atomic unit. For
     example, when fetching the content from its original location for updating
     an archive, user agents should not mix portions of the saved page and
     portions of the updated content.</p>
    <p>It sould be possible to render the contents of a MAFF file consistently
     after it has been extracted to a local file system and metadata has been
     removed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Design goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Easy to use and implement</b></p>
    <p>The specification of the file format must allow very simple
     implementations. For complex details, implementations should be able to
     rely on available libraries.<p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Based on existing and widely used technologies</b></p>
    <p>When considering solutions of similar complexity, in order to reach a
     particular goal, existing web standards and widely used specifications
     should be preferred to a custom implementation.</p>
    <p>Custom solutions may be appropriate if they are much more easy to
     implement compared to an existing specification, and the benefits of the
     existing specification do not apply to the particular use case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Compatible with the original MAFF format</b></p>
    <p>The file format previously referred to as <i>MAFF version 1</i> provides
     the baseline for all the future enhancements of the MAFF specification.
     This format is defined on the basis of the implementation of the Mozilla
     Archive Format extension version 0.6.3, for Firefox 2 and Mozilla 1.7-1.8,
     and version 0.8.0, for Firefox 3.0. Different versions of the extension are
     not considered.</p>
    <p>The MAFF format will be extended while ensuring that all implementations
     will still be able to read MAFF archives created with version 0.6.3 and
     0.8.0 of Mozilla Archive Format.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Conformance levels</h3>
<p>In order to satisfy the requirement of simplicity of implementation, and to
 encourage early adoption of the format, different conformance levels are
 available to implementors.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b><a name="level-elementary"></a>Elementary</b></p>
    <p>Read-enabled implementations at this level can display the contents of
     most of the MAFF files generated by implementations at the elementary or
     basic level, and almost all of the MAFF files generated by implementations
     at the normal level, but may not always be able to access the metadata.</p>
    <p>Write-enabled implementations at this level do not store metadata, or
     store it in such a way that does not guarantee that conforming readers will
     be able to read it. Implementations at the elementary or basic level will
     be able to display the contents of most of the MAFF files generated by
     implementations at this level, while implementations at the normal level
     will be able to display the contents of almost all of the generated MAFF
     files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b><a name="level-basic"></a>Basic</b></p>
    <p>Read-enabled implementations at this level can display the contents of
     most of the MAFF files generated by implementations at the elementary or
     basic level, and almost all of the MAFF files generated by implementations
     at the normal level. Implementations at this level can access the metadata
     of most of the MAFF files generated by implementations at the basic level,
     and almost all of the MAFF files generated by implementations at the
     normal level.</p>
    <p>Write-enabled implementations at this level may store metadata.
     Implementations at the elementary or basic level will be able to display
     the contents of most of the MAFF files generated by implementations at this
     level, while implementations at the normal level will be able to display
     the contents of almost all of the generated MAFF files. Implementations at
     the basic level will be able to access the metadata of most of the MAFF
     files generated by implementations at this level, while implementations at
     the normal level will be able to access the metadata of almost all of the
     generated MAFF files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b><a name="level-normal"></a>Normal</b></p>
    <p><i>This level is not yet formalized, and no conforming implementations
     can exist at this time. Implementations at this level should keep into
     account most of the possible interoperability issues. Implementations that
     aim at reaching this level should be updated to reflect the evolution of
     the stabilized aspects of this specification.</i></p>
    <p>Read-enabled implementations at this level can display the contents of
     almost all of the MAFF files generated by implementations at the elementary
     or basic level, and virtually all of the MAFF files generated by
     implementations at the normal level. Implementations at this level can
     access the metadata of almost all of the MAFF files generated by
     implementations at the basic level, and virtually all of the MAFF files
     generated by implementations at the normal level.</p>
    <p>Write-enabled implementations at this level may store metadata.
     Implementations at the elementary or basic level will be able to display
     the contents of almost all of the MAFF files generated by implementations
     at this level, while implementations at the normal level will be able to
     display the contents of virtually all of the generated MAFF files.
     Implementations at the basic level will be able to access the metadata of
     almost all of the MAFF files generated by implementations at this level,
     while implementations at the normal level will be able to access the
     metadata of virtually all of the generated MAFF files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b><a name="level-custom"></a>Custom or extended</b></p>
    <p>This level applies to ideas and requirements that are not part of the
     base specification, even though they are related to the file format and are
     under discussion. Some of these requirements may be outside of the scope of
     the base specification, and should be considered extensions, while others
     may be considered for inclusion in the basic or normal conformance
     levels.</p>
    <p>Since none of the custom or extended requirements are meant to be stable,
     implementors may need to change their implementations substantially if
     conflicting requirements are introduced in the basic or standard
     conformance levels.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Page</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>An atomic unit of related archived content. Multiple independent pages
     can be stored in a single MAFF archive.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Main document</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The top-level file of a page, that is generally displayed in a web
     browser window.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>File extension and type</h2>
<p>MAFF files should be saved using the <code class="maf-file-ext">.maff</code>
 file extension (lowercase is recommended), even on systems where file
 extensions are not normally used to identify file types. [Conformance level:
 <a href="#level-elementary">elementary</a>]</p>
<p>Implementations should treat files with the
 <code class="maf-file-ext">.maff</code> file extension (case insensitive)
 as MAFF files, even on systems where file extensions are not normally used to
 identify file types. [Conformance level: <a href="#level-basic">basic</a>]</p>
<p>Internally, the Mozilla Archive Format extension for Firefox registers the
 MIME type <code class="maf-mime-type">application/x-maff</code> for files with
 the <code class="maf-file-ext">.maff</code> extension, unless there is already
 another MIME type association in the system. However, this MIME type is not
 advertised outside of Firefox, for example when the file type is registered
 with the operating system on Windows. [Information]</p>

<h2>ZIP implementation</h2>
<p>The ZIP implementation must be based on
 <a href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">PKWARE's ZIP
 Application Note</a> [Conformance level:
 <a href="#level-elementary">elementary</a>].</p>
<p>File and directory names must be stored using UTF-8 [Conformance level:
 <a href="#level-basic">basic</a>].</p>
<p><i>This section needs expansion.</i></p>

<h2>Directory structure</h2>
<p>The root directory of the archive must be empty. [Conformance level:
 <a href="#level-elementary">elementary</a>]</p>
<p>One first-level directory must be present for every saved page. At least one
 page must be present in the archive. No additional first-level directories must
 be present. [Conformance level: <a href="#level-elementary">elementary</a>]</p>
<p>Every first-level directory should contain a file named <tt>index.rdf</tt>,
 with the metadata. [Conformance level: <a href="#level-basic">basic</a>].</p>
<p>If the <tt>index.rdf</tt> file is not present, the main document must be
 stored in a file named <tt>index</tt>, with a file extension based on the
 content type. If the content type of the main document is HTML, the file must
 be named <tt>index.html</tt>. [Conformance level:
 <a href="#level-elementary">elementary</a>]</p>
<p>If the <tt>index.rdf</tt> file is present, the metadata must contain the name
 of the file containing the main document. This file must be located in the same
 folder as the <tt>index.rdf</tt> file. This file must be named <tt>index</tt>,
 with a file extension based on the content type, unless the file type is RDF.
 [Conformance level: <a href="#level-basic">basic</a>]</p>
<p>Assignment of MIME type to individual files is implemented by ensuring that
 the file names of supported content match a list of well-known file
 extensions. [Conformance level: <a href="#level-normal">normal</a>]</p>
<p><i>This section needs expansion.</i></p>

<h2>Metadata</h2>
<p>The format used for storing metadata about the archived files in the
 <tt>index.rdf</tt> and <tt>history.rdf</tt> files is RDF/XML.</p>
<p>Some restrictions for the RDF/XML file format are still to be specified.
 These restrictions are required to allow for read-enabled implementations that
 are as simple as possible. In particular, only one of the possible XML
 representations of the RDF graph is valid. This is the current representation
 that uses the <tt>MAF</tt> XML namespace. In this way, a full RDF parser would
 not be required to read the metadata.</p>
<p>Further restrictions on the structure and format of the XML files are under
 consideration. For example, implementations might be required to put one tag
 per line, always use UTF-8 encoding, and never encode characters as entities
 unless necessary. This would make room for very simple implementations that
 don't embed an XML parser.</p>
<p>The following information is stored in <tt>index.rdf</tt>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>file name</b> of the main document.</li>
  <li>The <b>original URL</b> the page was saved from.</li>
  <li>The <b>date and time</b> of the save operation.</li>
  <li>The <b>title</b> of the page, if present.</li>
  <li>The <b>character set</b> to use when parsing files that are part of the
   page.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This section needs expansion.</i></p>

<h3>Date and time</h3>
<p>The date and time of the save operation should be stored using the format
 described in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.3">RFC 5322
 section 3.3</a>. If this format is not used, the Mozilla JavaScript Date format
 must be used. Implementations must be able to parse both formats. [Conformance
 level: <a href="#level-basic">basic</a>]</p>

<h3>Title</h3>
<p>If the file format of the main document allows an explicit page title to be
 specified, like HTML does, the title from the metadata should match the title
 from the main document, and if the title is not available, this field should be
 omitted. [Conformance level: <a href="#level-basic">basic</a>]</p>
<p>This metadata field allows applications that want to display information
 about the contents of MAFF archives to do this without embedding an HTML
 parser. For example, an extension for a file manager might only use the title
 from the metadata, while a web browser might ignore this field and only display
 the title resulting from parsing the main document. [Information]</p>
<p>When the title of the page is not available, some versions of the Mozilla
 Archive Format extension for Firefox write the literal English string
 "Unknown", even though the field should be omitted. [Information]</p>

<h3>Character set</h3>
<p>The character set declared in the MAFF archive should be used when parsing
 the contents of all the files that do not declare a different character set.
 [Conformance level: <a href="#level-basic">basic</a>]</p>

<h2>Extended metadata</h2>
<p>The base specification does not provide a facility for storing the original
 URL from which each individual file was copied from, as each page is handled as
 an atomic unit. This feature is under consideration as an extension, but even
 if this information is present, implementations must not rely on it to be able
 to properly display the page. [Conformance level:
 <a href="#level-custom">extended</a>]</p>
<p>The base specification does not consider custom MIME or HTTP headers
 associated with individual files, as the MAFF format is designed to work in the
 same way as when a saved page is opened directly from a local file system. This
 feature is however under discussion as an extension. Implementations should not
 rely on this feature unless necessary, since it may not be available in other
 implementations. [Conformance level: <a href="#level-custom">extended</a>]</p>
<p>Storing and replaying arbitrary MIME headers in an archive can be subject to
 security considerations. While static information about the content itself,
 like the <tt>Content-Type</tt> header, is generally safe to be used from every
 location, information about the relation of the content with other resources
 may not apply anymore when the resource is moved. For example, a site may be
 listed as allowed in a Content Security Policy header, but this trust
 relationship is only relevant at the time the content is generated, and should
 not be used later.</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>Current work on this specification is focused on documenting the essential
 aspects of the MAFF file format and improving the level of detail in response
 to specific questions.</p>
<p>In order to participate in this process, interested people and implementors
 are encouraged to provide feedback on the <a href="#feedback">mailing list of
 the MAF project</a>.</p>
