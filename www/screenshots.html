  <h3>Save in web archives</h3>
  <p>Web archives are better than the normal way of saving pages. When you save
   a complete page as HTML, a folder full of small files is also created. The
   result may easily become unreadable when moved to other computers or burned
   onto a CD-ROM. Saving each page in a single file, instead, makes sure that
   they will remain readable in the future, and allows for faster backups and
   easier file management.</p>
</div>
<div class="maf-feature-box">
  <h3>Include video and audio</h3>
  <p>Using the MAFF web archive format, you can save multimedia files together
   with the page, for example a blog post that includes some videos. Combined
   with the built-in browser support for <b>Vorbis</b>, <b>Theora</b>, and
   <b>WebM</b> multimedia files in HTML5, MAFF becomes ideal for packaging
   video, audio, and related resources in a portable file.</p>

  <h3>Faithful save system</h3>
  <p>This feature allows your browser to save every page with greater accuracy,
   including all styles and images. When you open a page that you saved with the
   Mozilla Archive Format add-on installed, you see an exact snapshot of what
   was displayed when you initiated the save command. This is also true for
   complete pages saved outside of a web archive.</p>
</div>
<div class="maf-feature-box">
  <h3>Save many pages in a single file</h3>
  <p>You can save multiple tabs in a single MAFF archive. Moreover, if you use
   the Multiple Tab Handler add-on, you can easily select which tabs to
   save.</p>

  <h3>Link to the original</h3>
  <p>Every web archive contains the original address from which the page was
   saved, as well as the date of the save operation. With Mozilla Archive
   Format, you can find again and reopen the original website, not only for new
   archives but even for pages previously saved using Internet Explorer.</p>
</div>
<div class="maf-feature-box">
  <h3>Convert the file format of saved pages</h3>
  <p>The Saved Pages Conversion Wizard can guide you through the conversion of
   your previously saved web pages to a different file format. You can convert
   old pages to MAFF, if you want to save disk space or prevent problems when
   burning a CD-ROM. You can also convert MAFF back to other formats, in case
   you need to interoperate with other applications. Thanks to this feature and
   the fact that MAFF is an open format, you will never find yourself in the
   situation of being unable to read the web archives you created.</p>

  <h3>Simple yet powerful</h3>
  <p>You can recommend Mozilla Archive Format to your friends because it is easy
   to use for everyone. The underlying functionality is still very powerful, and
   the add-on will generally do the right thing automatically, like preserving
   the original date and time of previously saved pages. And for the advanced
   user, many behavioral details can be tweaked from the <tt>about:config</tt>
   page as explained in the <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="maf-feature-box">
  <h3>Customizable</h3>
  <p>Depending on your habits, you can use the dedicated <b>Save Page In Archive
   As</b> menu item, or select a web archive file type from the standard <b>Save
   Page As</b> dialog box. If you don't use some menu items or prefer to have
   more commands readily available from the context menu, you can optimize the
   user interface to suit your needs.</p>

  <h3>Minimal disk usage</h3>
  <p>Saving pages as MAFF lets you minimize disk usage and access time on slow
   media, since MAFF is based on the universal, compressed ZIP file format. A
   page saved as MAFF is smaller than the same page saved as individual files,
   and much smaller than MHTML, because the latter is encoded in a way that
   makes it usually larger than the original page.</p>
</div>
<div class="maf-feature-box">
  <h3>Fast</h3>
  <p>Opening MAFF files is nearly instantaneous thanks to the native support
   for ZIP files of Firefox and SeaMonkey. For creating and opening MHTML
   files, Mozilla Archive Format uses the fastest JavaScript routines
   available for MIME encoding and decoding, that have been developed
   specifically for the add-on.</p>
</div>
<div class="maf-feature-box">
  <h3>100% compatible</h3>
  <p>Web archives created with Firefox or SeaMonkey in the MHTML format are 100%
   compatible with Internet Explorer and other browsers. MAFF archives are also
   created in such a way that they are fully compatible with any modern ZIP
   extraction utility.</p>
  <p>Mozilla Archive Format is designed to integrate not only with the browser,
   but with many <a href="documentation.html#extensions">compatible
   extensions</a> as well. For example, you can use UnMHT if you want advanced
   options when saving MHTML files, or a download organizer to select your
   download folders and file names automatically.</p>
</div>

<div class="maf-feature-text">
  <h3>Open archives by clicking icon</h3>
  <p>On Windows, Mozilla Archive Format can configure your operating system so
   that web archives are opened in Firefox or SeaMonkey when you click their
   icon. For Linux, the same file type association can be created with manual
   steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="maf-feature-box">
  <h3>Free and Open Source</h3>
  <p>Mozilla Archive Format is and will always be free for everyone to use,
   modify, and adapt to their needs. MAFF is an open file format whose technical
   specification is maintained by the MAF project. The latest version of the
   add-on is distributed under a choice of several Open Source and Free Software
   licenses: the Mozilla Public License 1.1, the GNU General Public License 2.0,
   the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1, or any later version of these
   licenses.</p>
</div>
<div class="maf-feature-box">
  <h3>Popular and widely used</h3>
  <p>Mozilla Archive Format is used daily by over 50,000 people. In case
   something doesn't work as you expected, you can <a href="feedback.html">ask
