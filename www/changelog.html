  <h2>Changelog for version 5.0</h2>
  <h3>What's new in version 5.0?</h3>
  <p>MAF 5.0 has the following user-visible improvements over MAF 4.1.3:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="documentation.html">This add-on will not work in future
     versions of Firefox.</a> Several changes have been made to help the
     transition to alternative solutions for archiving web pages locally:
      <ul>
        <li>On the latest version of Firefox, the options dialog now warns that
         the add-on will not work in the future, and allows the <b>Save In
         Archive</b> commands to be disabled while keeping the ability to open
         existing archives.</li>
        <li>On Windows, file associations for MHTML are not created by default
         anymore, while MAFF files are still associated with the browser. The
         associations are now created for the current user only, even if the
         browser is executed with administration privileges.</li>
        <li>The Saved Pages Conversion Wizard has been redesigned so that by
         default it will search the <b>Downloads</b> folder for web archives and
         convert them to complete web pages with separate folders for data
         files.</li>
        <li>The reliability and speed of the conversion has been improved, and
         the browser will now work offline during the process by default.</li>
        <li>Multi-page MAFF archives can now be converted to individual MHTML
         archives or to complete web pages with separate folders for data
         files.</li>
        <li>Saving a complete web page now always takes an exact snapshot even
         if the <b>Save In Archive</b> commands are disabled.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The compatibility of saved MHTML files with recent versions of Internet
     Explorer has been improved.</li>
    <li>The welcome page is not displayed at startup anymore. Future versions of
     the add-on will display a new welcome page with information on compatiblity
     and file format conversion.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changelog for version 4.1</h2>
  <h3>Changes from 4.1.2 to 4.1.3</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> When installing the add-on for the first time in Firefox 54,
     multi-process could inadvertently remain enabled until the next restart,
     even though the add-on is marked as incompatible.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 4.1.1 to 4.1.2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Inaccessible files and directories are now ignored when
     looking for pages to convert.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 4.1.0 to 4.1.1</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Conversion to MHTML and MAFF from other formats could fail,
     and images would not be converted.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 4.0.2 to 4.1.0</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Compatibility with the latest versions of Firefox and
     SeaMonkey. As part of the change, support for upgrading directly from
     version 0.7.1 or earlier of the add-on was removed. Very old systems that
     are updgraded directly may be affected by the inability to open any MAFF
     archive.</li>
    <li><b>Change:</b> The internal integration with the browser source code has
     been modified, potentially affecting compatibility with third-party add-ons
     that also integrate with the browser using internal methods.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Background tabs restored from a previous session are now
     reloaded correctly when saving multiple tabs in an archive.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changelog for version 4.0</h2>
  <h3>What was new in version 4.0?</h3>
  <p>MAF 4.0.2 had the following user-visible improvements over MAF 3.1.0:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When multi-process Firefox is enabled, compatibility information is
     displayed in English in the main pane of the options dialog, and the dialog
     is shown automatically the first time this condition is detected.</li>
    <li>Partial compatibility with multi-process Firefox:
      <ul>
        <li>Full support for displaying the contents of web archives.</li>
        <li>The notification bar with information about the original save date
         and location is not displayed when multi-process Firefox is
         enabled.</li>
        <li>Web archives cannot be created when multi-process Firefox is
         enabled, however it is now possible to use the browser's standard save
         system to save complete web pages in multiple files, without disabling
         the add-on first.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Several features have been removed or redesigned in preparation for full
     compatibility with multi-process Firefox:
      <ul>
        <li>Taking an exact snapshot of the page is now required to create web
         archives, and the browser's standard save system can only be used to
         save complete web pages in multiple files. All the generated MHTML
         files are now fully compatible with other browsers, since the option to
         create partially compatible archives using the browser's standard save
         system is not available anymore.</li>
        <li>The separate Archives dialog has been removed.</li>
        <li>The integrated Save Complete component has been removed.</li>
        <li>The existing integration with the page context menu, the Tools menu,
         and the application menu of older versions of Firefox has been removed
         in favor of the integration with the customizable menu button.</li>
        <li>The preference to use the page title instead of the default
         suggested file name in the "Save As" dialog has been removed since this
         is now the default naming strategy in Firefox.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 4.0.1 to 4.0.2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> This version is now marked as incompatible with
     multi-process, solving an issue in Firefox 51 and later versions for which
     multi-process could be inadvertently enabled even though this add-on was
     installed.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Compatibility with the latest versions of Firefox and
     SeaMonkey.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 4.0b6 to 4.0.0</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Suggest workaround for a known issue for which the
     selection with the left mouse buton does not work in the Save Tabs In
     Archive dialog.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 4.0b5 to 4.0b6</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Compatibility with the latest versions of Firefox and
     SeaMonkey.</li>
    <li><b>New:</b> The first time a version of the add-on previously installed
     from the Release Channel is run on a pre-release version of the browser, a
     page is displayed asking to receive the add-on updates from the Beta
     Channel available on the official Mozilla Add-ons website.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 4.0b4 to 4.0b5</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Compatibility with the latest versions of Firefox and
     SeaMonkey.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 4.0b3 to 4.0b4</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> The warning for the flags argument of the String.replace
     function is not displayed in the Browser Console anymore.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 4.0b2 to 4.0b3</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Compatibility with the latest versions of Firefox and
     SeaMonkey.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 4.0b1 to 4.0b2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Compatibility with the latest versions of Firefox and
     SeaMonkey.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Images displayed in web pages were not saved.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changelog for version 3.1</h2>
  <h3>Changes from 3.0.3 to 3.1.0</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> The internal structure of the source code has been
     modified, removing compatibility with older versions of Firefox and
     SeaMonkey. This may also affect compatibility with third-party add-ons
     that integrate with Mozilla Archive Format using internal methods.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changelog for version 3.0</h2>
  <h3>What was new in version 3.0?</h3>
  <p>MAF 3.0.3 had the following user-visible improvements over MAF 2.0.6:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improved compactness when saving complete web pages:
      <ul>
        <li>Stylesheet rules that don't apply to any element in the current page
         are now removed from the saved file. This can greatly increase
         compactness when content is modified by scripts or other extensions
         before saving.</li>
        <li>The option to take an exact snapshot of the page is now selected by
         default, to take advantage of various improvements in the save method,
         even if it was deselected in a previous version of the add-on. The
         browser's standard save system and the integrated Save Complete
         component can still be selected from the options dialog and the
         internal configuration settings respectively.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The notification bar with information about the original save date and
     location can now be disabled from the options.</li>
    <li>Now file associations on Windows are created correctly when using the
     add-on in third-party browsers based on Firefox or SeaMonkey.</li>
    <li>Removed elements:
      <ul>
        <li>The option to display an archive information icon in the status bar
         is not available anymore, together with the option to display the icon
         in the location bar at all times. The icon can only be displayed in the
         location bar when an archived page is opened.</li>
        <li>The creation of MHTML files that are fully compatible with other
         browsers cannot be explicitly disabled anymore. All the generated MHTML
         files are now fully compatible, as long as the option to take an exact
         snapshot of the page is selected.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 3.0.2 to 3.0.3</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Compatibility with the latest versions of Firefox and
     SeaMonkey.</li>
  </ul>

     by changing the file type in the "Save As" dialog in Firefox 29 and later
     versions.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> The toolbar button of the <a
     href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/work-offline/">Work Offline</a>
     add-on was corrupted in Firefox 28.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Now the <b>Save Page</b> command saves HTML and XHTML
     documents in archives by default, for improved compatibility with the user
     interface of the latest version of Firefox.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Sometimes saving pages with several elements could fail,
     reporting the error "too much recursion".</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 3.0b1 to 3.0.0</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Compatibility with the latest versions of Firefox and
     SeaMonkey.</li>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Background tabs restored from a previous session are now
     reloaded automatically when saving multiple tabs in an archive.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Pages saved from private windows were listed together with
     downloads started from public windows.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> The information bar appeared then disappeared immediately
     when selecting a background tab for the first time.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Adding archives to the Archives dialog did not work.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 3.0a3 to 3.0b1</h3>

     searching a directory that included invalid file names.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 3.0a2 to 3.0a3</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> The <b>Open File</b> menu command didn't work on Firefox 17,
     as well as the latest version of SeaMonkey.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 3.0a1 to 3.0a2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Compatibility with the latest versions of Firefox and
     SeaMonkey. The add-on is no longer compatible with older browser versions,
     including Firefox 3.6 and SeaMonkey 2.1.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changelog for version 2.0</h2>
  <h3>What was new in version 2.0?</h3>
  <p>MAF 2.0.6 had the following user-visible improvements over MAF 1.0.0:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Greatly improved performance, accuracy and compactness when the option
     to take a faithful snapshot of the page is selected:
      <ul>
        <li>Pages are saved instantly, because hidden content that is not needed
         to display the current state of the page is not downloaded
         anymore.</li>
        <li>Saved pages can be much smaller, since they do not include unneeded
         content.</li>
        <li>Saved pages can be displayed more accurately, because now scripts
         specified using event attributes or "javascript:" URIs are also
         removed, making sure that they cannot modify the page structure when it
         is opened later.</li>
        <li>If an image or other support resource is not found, the error page
         is not saved in place of the missing resource anymore.</li>
        <li>Images and other content that could not be saved are not connected
         to their original location anymore, leading to truly offline archives
         and making it possible to verify that all content has been saved.</li>
        <li>Saved MHTML archives can now be previewed correctly in Windows, even
         if they contain text in a language other than English.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A notification bar with information about the original save date and
     location is now displayed for all archived pages.</li>
    <li>Updating to the new version makes sure that all the customized
     <a href="documentation.html#internalsettings">internal configuration
     settings</a> are reset to their default value, resolving problems caused
     by old settings that, starting with version 1.0, could be changed only from
     the <tt>about:config</tt> page. There is usually no need to customize those
     settings anymore.</li>
    <li>Now it is possible to link to a specific section inside an archived
     page, appending a fragment or hash part to the URI of the archived
     page.</li>
    <li>The integrated
     <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4723">Save Complete</a>
     component is now able to save framesets.</li>
    <li>The Saved Pages Conversion Wizard is now able to recognize complete web
     pages saved using Firefox or SeaMonkey in several languages other than
     English and the current browser language.</li>
    <li>The add-on is no longer tested with Firefox 3.0, Firefox 3.5, and
     SeaMonkey 2.0.</li>
    <li>Bugfixes:
      <ul>
        <li>Some images in MHTML pages didn't appear, if they were referenced
         using the "style" attribute.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 2.0.5 to 2.0.6</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Sometimes blank tabs appeared instead of actual content when
     opening multi-page MAFF archives on Firefox 12 and later versions.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 2.0.4 to 2.0.5</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Opening MAFF archives containing file names that used
     international characters didn't work on Firefox 10 and later versions.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Inline stylesheets containing international characters were
     not saved correctly when the option to take a faithful snapshot of the page
     was selected.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> The edited content of form fields wasn't saved if the
     original web page didn't specify the type of field correctly.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> When using the
     <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/more-tools-menu/">More Tools
     Menu</a> add-on, the visibility of the Mozilla Archive Format menu items
     wasn't always updated correctly.</li>

  <h3>Changes from 2.0.3 to 2.0.4</h3>

    <li><b>Fix:</b> Opening multi-page MAFF archives didn't work on Firefox 9

    <li><b>Notice:</b> This version does not introduce any functional change,
     but is now declared compatible with the latest versions of Firefox and
     SeaMonkey. This version is only available on the Preview Channel of the
     official Mozilla Archive Format website. Users that installed from the
     Mozilla Add-ons website, or from the main link on the official Mozilla
     Archive Format website, can still use version 2.0.2 if they let Firefox or
     SeaMonkey find new versions of the add-on automatically.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Content encoded using the "data:" URI scheme was not saved
     correctly when the option to take a faithful snapshot of the page was
     selected.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Content generated dynamically inside frames was not saved if
     the <tt>src</tt> attribute was missing from the frame element.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Sometimes content could be missing from pages saved under a
     low memory condition.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> When saving pages on Firefox 6 and later versions, sometimes
     an error message was displayed despite the page was saved correctly.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 2.0.0 to 2.0.1</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Compatibility with SeaMonkey 2.0.</li>

    <li>It is now possible to configure MAF to open MAFF archives without
     extracting their contents to the temporary directory, thus obtaining a
     significant speed gain.</li>

         archives on some file systems.</li>
        <li>Now pages are saved as they appear, without fetching them again from
         the server, in all the cases where it is possible. This may speed up

     the media files directly from the archive.</li>

     MAFF archives, the archived files are not extracted to the temporary
     directory anymore, thus obtaining a significant speed gain.</li>

         As</b>.</li>
        <li>The <b>Show a message box when completing a single page archival</b>

  <h2>Changelog for version 0.8</h2>

        <li>Handle only the <tt>.maff</tt> extension, and not its variations,
         since double extensions cannot be handled correctly by Firefox.</li>
        <li>Removed support for the old <tt>.maf</tt> and <tt>.maff.zip</tt>
         extensions.</li>
        <li>Added support for <tt>.mhtml</tt> file extension for MHTML
         archives.</li>
        <li>MAF does not register applications for its MIME types anymore.</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Bugfixes:
      <ul>
        <li>Opening archives from the command-line or by double-clicking a file
         when no browser windows are visible now works reliably.</li>
        <li>Now the save functions always overwrite the contents of existing
         archives, rather than appending.</li>
        <li>Copying archive metadata to the clipboard works again.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 0.8.4 to 0.8.7</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>New:</b> Several localizations have been updated.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> When the archive extension (for instance, <tt>.maff</tt>)

     file already existed. This case was more common on operating systems other
     than Windows.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> Minor changes in the "Save Page As" and "Open File"
     integration.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 0.8.2 to 0.8.4</h3>

     Firefox built-in features to break.</li>
    <li><b>Change:</b> MAF is now able to open MAFF and MHTML archives even if
     their file type is customized in the user profile (customizations are
     visible in the "Applications" preferences pane of Firefox).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 0.8.0 to 0.8.2</h3>
  <ul>
