<h2>About the MAFF file format</h2>
<div class="maf-icon">
  <p><a href="maff-file-format.html">MAFF</a> files are <b>standard ZIP
   files</b> containing <b>one or more</b> web pages, images, or other
   downloadable content. Additional <b>metadata</b>, like the original page
   address, is saved along with the content. Unlike the related MHTML format,
   MAFF is compressed and particularly suited for large media files.</p>
</div>

<h2>About the Mozilla Archive Format add-on</h2>
<p>The Mozilla Archive Format add-on is an independently developed program that
 can be installed on
 <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/organizations/">Firefox Extended
 Support Release (ESR)</a> to open and save MAFF and MHTML archives.</p>
<div class="maf-box-warning">
  <p>The technology required by Mozilla Archive Format is no longer supported in
   Firefox since <b>November 14, 2017</b>, and support in Firefox ESR ends on
   <b>September 5, 2018</b>.</p>
</div>
<p>The ability to save web pages as MAFF or MHTML is disabled by default in
 Firefox. While this functionality can be
 <a href="documentation.html#preferences">enabled again from the options</a>,
 the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/724283">Save Page WE</a> add-on
 can also be installed alongside the Mozilla Archive Format add-on to save
 complete web pages in a single HTML file. Pages saved in this way will be
 compatible with future versions of Firefox.</p>
<h2>Converting previously saved pages</h2>
<p>A <a href="documentation.html#converting">guided procedure</a> can be used to
 convert your saved pages to a different file format. By default, the procedure
 will look for MAFF and MHTML archives and convert them to HTML pages which can
 be opened with any browser.</p>
<p><u>You should always keep a backup copy of the originals</u>, because in some
 cases the styling might not be replicated accurately.
 <a href="documentation.html#converting">Read the documentation for
 details.</a></p>
<p>The conversion is recommended for most situations, but if you have a large
 collection of saved web pages and converting them is not practical, you may
 consider the alternative solutions listed below.</p>
<h2>Other software supporting MAFF and MHTML archives</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>MAFF</b> files can be opened using any <b>ZIP extraction utility</b>,
   and most operating systems can recognize them natively after changing the
   file extension from <tt>.maff</tt> to <tt>.zip</tt>.</li>
  <li><b>MHTML</b> files can be opened using <b>Microsoft Internet Explorer</b>
   on Windows, and on other operating systems using <b>Google Chrome</b>.
   Archives created by older versions of the Mozilla Archive Format add-on may
   not be fully compatible with recent versions of these browser, and
   differences in how HTML and CSS is interpreted may make the pages look
   different even though the archives themselves are fully compatible.</li>
  <li>Other solutions to open MAFF and MHTML archives on Windows, Mac, and Linux
   may be developed in the future. Information about this third-party software
   will be provided on this website as it becomes available.</li>
