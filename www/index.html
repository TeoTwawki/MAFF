<h2>About the MAFF file format</h2>
<div class="maf-icon">
  <p><a href="maff-file-format.html">MAFF</a> files are <b>standard ZIP
   files</b> containing <b>one or more</b> web pages, images, or other
   downloadable content. Additional <b>metadata</b>, like the original page
   address, is saved along with the content. Unlike the related MHTML format,
   MAFF is compressed and particularly suited for large media files.</p>
</div>

<h2>About the Mozilla Archive Format add-on</h2>
<p>The Mozilla Archive Format add-on is an independently developed program that
 can be installed on the Firefox and SeaMonkey browsers to open and save MAFF
 and MHTML archives.</p>
<div class="maf-box-warning">
  <p>On or shortly after <b>November 14, 2017</b>, most installations of Firefox
   will be updated automatically to the new version known as
   <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/quantum/">Firefox Quantum</a>. This
   version does not support the Mozilla Archive Format add-on, and it will not
   be possible to use it to open or save MAFF and MHTML archives.</p>
</div>
<h3><u>Between October 15, 2017 and November 14, 2017</u></h3>
<p><b>The ability to save web pages as MAFF or MHTML will be disabled by default
 in Firefox.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>You can use the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/724283">Save
   Page WE</a> add-on to save complete web pages in a single HTML file. While
   this add-on may not be able to save parts of the page embedded from other
   websites, such as comment sections, the accuracy is generally comparable to
   that of the Mozilla Archive Format add-on.</li>
  <li>The ability to save as MAFF or MHTML can be re-enabled from the options of
   the add-on, keeping in mind that Firefox Quantum will not be able to open the
   pages saved in this way.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>You will be asked to convert your saved pages to view them in Firefox
 Quantum.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A <a href="documentation.html#converting">guided procedure</a> can be
     used to convert your saved pages to a different file format. By default,
     the procedure will look for MAFF and MHTML archives and convert them to
     HTML pages which can be opened with any browser, including Firefox
     Quantum.</p>
    <p><u>You should always keep a backup copy of the originals</u>, because in
     some cases the styling might not be replicated accurately.
     <a href="documentation.html#converting">Read the documentation for
     details.</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conversion is recommended for most situations, but if you have a
     large collection of saved web pages and converting them is not practical,
     you may consider the alternative solutions listed below.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Between November 14, 2017 and June 2018</u></h3>
<p><b>Most installations of Firefox will be updated to Firefox Quantum.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/724283">Save Page WE</a>
   add-on will continue to work in Firefox Quantum.</li>
  <li>If you still need to view or convert existing MAFF and MHTML archives, you
   can install <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/organizations/">Firefox
   Extended Support Release (ESR)</a> with the Mozilla Archive Format add-on. If
   at all possible, Firefox ESR should be installed as a separate user or on a
   different computer, because using both Firefox ESR and Firefox Quantum with
   the same user profile is not officially supported.</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>After June 2018</u></h3>
<p><b>Support for the Mozilla Archive Format add-on on both Firefox Extended
 Support Release and SeaMonkey will be discontinued.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>MAFF</b> files can be opened using any <b>ZIP extraction utility</b>,
   and most operating systems can recognize them natively after changing the
   file extension from <tt>.maff</tt> to <tt>.zip</tt>.</li>
  <li><b>MHTML</b> files can be opened using <b>Microsoft Internet Explorer</b>
   on Windows, and on other operating systems using <b>Google Chrome</b>.
   Archives created by older versions of the Mozilla Archive Format add-on may
   not be fully compatible with recent versions of these browser, and
   differences in how HTML and CSS is interpreted may make the pages look
   different even though the archives themselves are fully compatible.</li>
  <li>Other solutions to open MAFF and MHTML archives on Windows, Mac, and Linux
   may be developed in the future. Information about this third-party software
   will be provided on this website as it becomes available.</li>
