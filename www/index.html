<h2>About the MAFF file format</h2>
<div class="maf-icon">
  <p><a href="maff-file-format.html">MAFF</a> files are <b>standard ZIP
   files</b> containing <b>one or more</b> web pages, images, or other
   downloadable content. Additional <b>metadata</b>, like the original page
   address, is saved along with the content. Unlike the related MHTML format,
   MAFF is compressed and particularly suited for large media files.</p>
</div>
<p>Support for reading and writing MAFF archives was provided in the Mozilla
 Application Suite, Firefox, and SeaMonkey thanks to the Mozilla Archive Format
 add-on from 2004 to 2018. While the original add-on is no longer maintained, the
 <a href="maff-specification.html">file format specification</a> is still
 available and can be referenced by third-party software to provide better
 interoperability.</p>
<p>MAFF files can be opened using any ZIP extraction utility, and most operating
 systems can recognize them natively after changing the file extension from
 <tt>.maff</tt> to <tt>.zip</tt>. The original Mozilla Archive Format add-on
 also provided a procedure to convert MAFF files to other file formats, see the
 <a href="installation.html">archive</a> for details.</p>
