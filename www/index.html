<h2>About the MAFF file format</h2>
<div class="maf-icon">
  <p><a href="maff-file-format.html">MAFF</a> files are <b>standard ZIP
   files</b> containing <b>one or more</b> web pages, images, or other
   downloadable content. Additional <b>metadata</b>, like the original page
   address, is saved along with the content.</p>
</div>
<p>MAFF, compared to other web archive formats like
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML">MHTML</a> and single-page HTML, is
 particularly suited to package <b>video and audio</b> together with related web
 resources. This ability derives from the basic structure of the ZIP container,
 where <b>compression</b> can be used for web pages, and <b>verbatim storage</b>
 for content that requires fast streaming access and wouldn't benefit from being
 re-compressed, like most video and audio.</p>

<h2>About the Mozilla Archive Format add-on</h2>
<p>MAFF files can be opened using any ZIP extraction utility, and most operating
 systems can recognize them natively after changing the file extension from
 <tt>.maff</tt> to <tt>.zip</tt>. Full browser integration, however, is only
 available in Firefox and SeaMonkey after installing the
 <a href="installation.html">Mozilla Archive Format</a> add-on, which can handle
 both MAFF and MHTML files.</p>
