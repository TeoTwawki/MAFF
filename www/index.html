<h2>About the MAFF file format</h2>
<div class="maf-icon">
  <p><a href="maff-file-format.html">MAFF</a> files are <b>standard ZIP
   files</b> containing <b>one or more</b> web pages, images, or other
   downloadable content. Additional <b>metadata</b>, like the original page
   address, is saved along with the content. Unlike the related MHTML format,
   MAFF is compressed and particularly suited for large media files.</p>
</div>

<h2>About the Mozilla Archive Format add-on</h2>
<p>The Mozilla Archive Format add-on is an independently developed program that
 can be installed on
 <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/organizations/">Firefox Extended
 Support Release (ESR)</a> to open and save MAFF and MHTML archives.</p>
<div class="maf-box-warning">
  <p>The technology required by Mozilla Archive Format is no longer supported in
   Firefox since <b>November 14, 2017</b>, and support in Firefox ESR ends on
   <b>August 21, 2018</b>.</p>
</div>
<p>On <b>February 21, 2018</b>, most installations of the Mozilla Archive Format
 add-on in Firefox ESR will be updated automatically to provide advance notice
 of the end of support.</p>
<p><b>The option to save web pages as MAFF or MHTML will be disabled by
 default.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The accuracy of saved pages is unaffected, even though the default file
   format is different.</li>
  <li>The ability to save as MAFF or MHTML can be
   <a href="documentation.html#preferences">enabled again from the options of
   the add-on</a>, keeping in mind that current versions of Firefox and future
   versions of Firefox ESR will not be able to open the pages saved in this
   way.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>You will be asked to convert your saved pages to view them in future
 versions of Firefox.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A <a href="documentation.html#converting">guided procedure</a> can be
     used to convert your saved pages to a different file format. By default,
     the procedure will look for MAFF and MHTML archives and convert them to
     HTML pages which can be opened with any browser.</p>
    <p><u>You should always keep a backup copy of the originals</u>, because in
     some cases the styling might not be replicated accurately.
     <a href="documentation.html#converting">Read the documentation for
     details.</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conversion is recommended for most situations, but if you have a
     large collection of saved web pages and converting them is not practical,
     you may consider the alternative solutions listed below.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>On <b>August 21, 2018</b>, most installations of Firefox ESR will be updated
 automatically to a new version that does not support the Mozilla Archive Format
 add-on. The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/724283">Save Page WE</a>
 add-on can be used instead to save complete web pages in a single HTML file,
 with better accuracy than the browser's standard save system. This add-on is
 not compatible with current versions of Firefox ESR, but it can be used on the
 latest version of Firefox.</p>
<h2>Other software supporting MAFF and MHTML archives</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>MAFF</b> files can be opened using any <b>ZIP extraction utility</b>,
   and most operating systems can recognize them natively after changing the
   file extension from <tt>.maff</tt> to <tt>.zip</tt>.</li>
  <li><b>MHTML</b> files can be opened using <b>Microsoft Internet Explorer</b>
   on Windows, and on other operating systems using <b>Google Chrome</b>.
   Archives created by older versions of the Mozilla Archive Format add-on may
   not be fully compatible with recent versions of these browser, and
   differences in how HTML and CSS is interpreted may make the pages look
   different even though the archives themselves are fully compatible.</li>
  <li>Other solutions to open MAFF and MHTML archives on Windows, Mac, and Linux
   may be developed in the future. Information about this third-party software
   will be provided on this website as it becomes available.</li>
</ul>
