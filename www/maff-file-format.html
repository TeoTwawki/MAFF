  <h2 class="page-header">About the MAFF file format</h2>

<p>MAFF files are <b>standard ZIP files</b> containing <b>one or more</b> web
 pages, images, or other downloadable content. Additional information, like the
 original page address, is saved along with the content; this <b>metadata</b>
 allows the browser to open these files intelligently.</p>

<p>MAFF, compared to other web archive formats, is particularly suited to
 package <b>video and audio</b> together with related web resources. This
 ability derives from the basic structure of the ZIP container, where
 <b>compression</b> can be used for web pages, and <b>verbatim storage</b> for
 content that require fast streaming access and wouldn't benefit from being
 re-compressed, like most video and audio formats.</p>

<h2>Features of the MAFF file format</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Store web content in a single file</b></p>
    <p>The various files required to view a saved page as it appeared on-line
     are saved together, and cannot be separated by accident.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Store multiple independent pages in the same archive</b></p>
    <p>For example, Firefox with the MAF extension is able to save all the
     open tabs in a single file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Based on the ordinary ZIP / JAR format</b></p>
    <p>The ZIP format is supported natively on many modern operating systems.
     The contents of MAFF archives can be extracted using any ZIP extractor.
     The single files that are saved along with the main web page can be easily
     separated and inspected, in their original form, while preserving the
     advantages of storing the related content in a single file.</p>
    <p>Web pages in MAFF files are compressed, not encoded, with the result of
     the archive being often much smaller than the original web content.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Suited for video and audio files</b></p>
    <p>Since compression is used for web pages but not for already compressed
     content, most multimedia formats stored in MAFF files can be opened without
     the requirement of uncompressing the entire file. For example, this enables
     seeking instantly to the middle of a video, either stored locally or
     remotely available through a streaming source.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>View using the jar: protocol</b></p>
    <p>Even without the MAF extension, Mozilla Firefox is able to display the
     contents of MAFF archives natively, using the jar: protocol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Store metadata about the saved resources</b></p>
    <p>MAFF archives contain metadata like the original URL the page was saved
     from and the date/time of the save operation. The presence of this
     additional data is indifferent to ordinary ZIP extractors, but for
     example allows the Firefox browser with the MAF extension to perform
     operations like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opening the original page instead of the archived copy while
       on-line</li>
      <li>Enabling off-line navigation between pages in different archives</li>
      <li>Refreshing the archive contents with the latest on-line version
       <i>(not implemented in MAF at present)</i></li>
      <li>Asking web services like the Internet Archive about how the page
       appeared at the time it was saved <i>(not implemented in MAF at
       present)</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Store arbitrary extended metadata</b></p>
    <p>Extended metadata may include the browser's scroll position in the
     page, text zoom level, and more. The MAF extension for Firefox has an
     option to store this kind of data, even though the current version is not
     able to read it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Supported by Open Source products</b></p>
    <p>The MAF extension enables Firefox to handle MAFF archives intelligently.
     MAF is an Open Source product, released under the
     <a href="license.html">GNU General Public License</a>, and as such will
     continue to remain available in the future.</p>
    <p>There is no risk of vendor lock-in not only because of the open file
     format, but also because the MAF extension for Firefox allows batch
     conversion of already saved MAFF files to other web archive formats at any
     time.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
