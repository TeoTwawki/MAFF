<h2>Features of the MAFF file format</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Store web content in a single file</b></p>
    <p>The various files required to view a saved page as it appeared on-line
     are saved together, and cannot be separated by accident.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Store multiple independent pages in the same archive</b></p>
    <p>For example, Firefox with the MAF extension is able to save all the
     open tabs in a single file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Based on the ordinary ZIP / JAR format</b></p>
    <p>The ZIP format is supported natively on many modern operating systems.
     The contents of MAFF archives can be extracted using any ZIP extractor.
     The single files that are saved along with the main web page can be easily
     separated and inspected, in their original form, while preserving the
     advantages of storing the related content in a single file.</p>
    <p>Web pages in MAFF files are compressed, not encoded, with the result of
     the archive being often much smaller than the original web content.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Suited for video and audio files</b></p>
    <p>Since compression is used for web pages but not for already compressed
     content, most multimedia formats stored in MAFF files can be opened without
     the requirement of uncompressing the entire file. For example, this enables
     seeking instantly to the middle of a video, either stored locally or
     remotely available through a streaming source.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>View using the jar: protocol</b></p>
    <p>Even without the MAF extension, Mozilla browsers are able to display the
     contents of MAFF archives natively, using the jar: protocol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Store metadata about the saved resources</b></p>
    <p>MAFF archives contain metadata like the original URL the page was saved
     from and the date/time of the save operation. The presence of this
     additional data is indifferent to ordinary ZIP extractors, but for
     example allows the Firefox browser with the MAF extension to perform
     operations like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opening the original page instead of the archived copy while
       on-line</li>
      <li>Enabling off-line navigation between pages in different archives</li>
      <li>Refreshing the archive contents with the latest on-line version
       <i>(not implemented in MAF at present)</i></li>
      <li>Asking web services like the Internet Archive about how the page
       appeared at the time it was saved <i>(not implemented in MAF at
       present)</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Store arbitrary extended metadata</b></p>
    <p>Extended metadata may include the browser's scroll position in the
     page, text zoom level, and more. The MAF extension for Mozilla browsers has
     an option to store this kind of data, even though the current version is
     not able to read it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Supported by Open Source products</b></p>
    <p>The MAF add-on enables Mozilla-based browsers to handle MAFF archives
     intelligently. The latest version is distributed under a choice of several
     Open Source and Free Software licenses: the Mozilla Public License 1.1, the
     GNU General Public License 2.0, the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1,
     or any later version of these licenses. This means that the add-on will
     always remain available under one of these licenses in the future.</p>
    <p>There is no risk of vendor lock-in not only because of the open file
     format, but also because the MAF extension allows batch conversion of
     already saved MAFF files to other web archive formats at any time.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
